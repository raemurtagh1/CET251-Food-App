        <p>Chocolate is a usually sweet, brown food preparation of roasted and ground cacao seeds that is made in the
            form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. The earliest
            evidence of use traces to the Olmecs (modern day Mexico), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating to
            1900 BC.[1][2] The majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and
            Aztecs.[3] The word "chocolate" is derived from the Classical Nahuatl word chocolƒÅtl.</p>

        <p>The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After
            fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which
            are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by
            heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components:
            cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and
            cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugar. Powdered baking cocoa, which contains more
            fiber than it contains cocoa butter, can be processed with alkali to produce dutch cocoa. Much of the
            chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or
            added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or
            condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.</p>
