        <p>A doughnut or donut (the latter spelling often seen in American English and Canadian English) is a type of fried 
            dough confection or dessert food. It is popular in many countries and is prepared in various forms as a sweet snack 
            that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty vendors.</p>

        <p>Doughnuts are usually deep fried from a flour dough, and typically either ring-shaped or a number of shapes without a hole, 
            and often filled, but can also be ball-shaped ("doughnut holes"). Other types of batters can also be used, and various toppings 
            and flavorings are used for different types, such as sugar, chocolate, or maple glazing. Doughnuts may also include water, 
            leavening, eggs, milk, sugar, oil, shortening, and natural or artificial flavors.[1][2]</p>
        
        <p>The two most common types are the ring doughnut and the filled doughnut, which is injected with fruit preserves, cream, custard, 
            or other sweet fillings. Alternatively, small pieces of dough are sometimes cooked as doughnut holes. Once fried, doughnuts may 
            be glazed with a sugar icing, spread with icing or chocolate on top, or topped with powdered sugar, cinnamon, sprinkles or fruit. 
            Other shapes include rings, balls, flattened spheres, twists, and other forms. Doughnut varieties are also divided into cake 
            (including the old-fashioned) and yeast-risen type doughnuts. Doughnuts are often accompanied by coffee purchased at doughnut shops, 
            convenience stores, petrol stations, cafes or fast food restaurants, but can also be paired with milk.</p>
